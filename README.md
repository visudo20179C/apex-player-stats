# Apex Stats Page

## A single-page application to display user stats for the game Apex Legends

This is a personal project. This implementation was written in the VueJS framework. For styling, I'm using TailwindCSS.

- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

This project makes use of the mozambiquehe.re API. Visit their project page [here](https://apexlegendsapi.com/).

There is a live version of this project running [here](https://apex-stats.visudo.me/).

In order to use it, you must pass your Origin ID as a "name" parameter in the URI like so:

```
https://apex-stats.visudo.me/?name=visudo20179C
or
https://apex-stats.visudo.me?name=visudo20179C
